# Projects

A curated list of my software development projects, organized by area and purpose.

This repository serves as a portfolio entry point with links to my main work.

## Backend Projects

### Library Management System (Java, JDBC, PostgreSQL)
Console-based Java backend application focused on clean architecture and database interaction.

Key aspects:
- JDBC integration with PostgreSQL
- DAO pattern for data access abstraction
- Layered architecture (domain, DAO, system layers)
- Console-based navigation and input validation

### Picture Gallery API (Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, PostgreSQL)

Backend REST API for managing and exploring a picture gallery domain.

The project was built with a database-first approach and focuses on backend architecture, data access, and security.  
It provides endpoints for working with pictures, authors, eras, techniques, plots, and users.

Key highlights:
- Spring Boot REST API
- JDBC / JdbcTemplate with DAO pattern
- Clear separation between controllers, DAO interfaces, and JDBC implementations
- RowMapper-based mapping from ResultSet to POJOs
- JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization
- Many-to-many relationships (user favorite authors and pictures)
- API testing with Postman
- ERD and UML diagrams included for database and architecture overview

The project is intentionally backend-only.  
A client application will be implemented as a separate final project.
